-When using $new Formdata() to capture the value passed/submitted by a form..remember that the returned object is an array.

-When using a generic/type parameter with an arrow function, we must add a comma (i.e <Type,>),otherwise the compiler will think it is JSX..the comma makes the compiler realize that its not valid JSX and must therefore be a type parameter.


**TS errors,meanings & solutions:

    -Element implicitly has an 'any' type because expression of type 'myType' can't be used to index type 'myInterface'.
     No index signature with a parameter of type 'myType' was found on type 'myInterface'.
        ----->Solution is to typecast using (as keyof myInterface);

**CSS:
-align-content is different from align-items,it should be used to align multi lines flexboxes (i.e when using flex-wrap)
